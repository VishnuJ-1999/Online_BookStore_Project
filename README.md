The Online Book Store is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse books, view details, manage a cart, and complete purchases through integrated online payment.
It is built using a Django backend, a React.js frontend, and SQLite as the database.
The project follows clean architecture, REST API design, secure authentication, and real-time data communication between frontend and backend.
